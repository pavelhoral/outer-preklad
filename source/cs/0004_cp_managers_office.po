"We have investigated the claims made against the profitability of the greater Emerald Vale region. Our offices agree with you; agriculture and fishing/canning have experienced a steady decline, while the Emerald Vale Geothermal Plant remains somewhat profitable. Our offices are currently investigating ways to implement additional cost-saving measures, which will ultimately lead to a leaner, more streamlined, more efficient Geothermal Power Plant.\n"

"Please be informed that the Spacer's Choice Development and Oversight Office has taken a significant insurance policy against the Emerald Vale Geothermal Plant. The office would like to assure you that this insurance policy is a standard procedure. DO NOT attempt to interpret, understand, or otherwise extrapolate meaning from this decision. \n"

"As a special courtesy, we have deployed a proprietary team of engineering specialists to the Emerald Vale Geothermal Plant. This team of specialists has been instructed to refit and upgrade the plant's population of automechanicals - free of charge.\n"
