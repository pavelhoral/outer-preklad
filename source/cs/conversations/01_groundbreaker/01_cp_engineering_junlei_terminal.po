"\r\n"
"She's got a mind for details. Nothing gets overlooked, and the littlest things mean so much to her. If she were a ship she'd have a million and a half separate systems running in harmony - nothing wasted, nothing redundant, everything on time. \r\n"
"\r\n"
"It's cute how she hangs on my every word. Leans in close like a potted plant reaching for the sun. I want to show her everything I know she hasn't seen, and I want her to teach me everything I don't already know. A girl could do a lot worse than see the world through Parvati's eyes. "
