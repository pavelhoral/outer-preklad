And while I shan't deign to step outside and explore this culinary frontier myself, I sent an armed guard to procure one such delectable morsel for my personal enjoyment. Alex, the taste defies description. Meaty, chewy, a mouthfeel of gristle and autumn leaves - and the range of available gourmet dipping mustards confounds my wildest expectations. Confounds! \r\n"

"Sail your beautiful barge back to Groundbreaker, dear Alex, that we might indulge ourselves on the fruit of the noble space rat and toast to the culinary achievements of our fellow colonists. \r\n"
