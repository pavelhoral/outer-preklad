"...\r\n"

"Conclusion and Analysis:\r\n"
"\r\n"
"The experiment recapitulates the results of Trials #1-5. Each successive generation of spectrum potatoes atrophies in quality, size, and nutritional content. After five generations, crops invariably fail. The soil in Emerald Vale is inviable, and any attempts at industrial agriculture are likely to be unprofitable. "

"\r\n"
"My experiments were flawed from the beginning. Our parent company refused to send us adequate experimental equipment, citing budgetary problems. I'm sure the accountants at headquarters know what they're doing, so I can't question them. Personally, I don't know why the soil in Emerald Vale resists our every attempt at cultivation. Local volcanism and a biosphere rich with native flora supports the possibility of botanical cultivation. But nothing seems to grow.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"I suspect it may simply be a question of plant nutrition. Good soil requires a healthy mix of organic compounds. If corporate had sent us decent fertilizer, we might have seen some real success. Unfortunately, we've had to make do with the old, rotten contents of saltuna cans. \r\n"
