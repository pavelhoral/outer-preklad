"Factory's back online. Feels strange. Not only did I never think I'd stoop to this sort of work, but they gave me your place on the line. \n"
"\n"
"Wish you could've waited. Just for a little while. But that's fine... me and cousin Isaac are right as rain, we are.\n"
"\n"
"I never met a man so eccentric as the factory's new owner, Clive. Got a dreadful temper, he does. But he pays our wages on time, so I guess I don't rightly mind.\n"
"\n"
"Just... if you ain't coming back, you could at least answer my darned messages \n"
"I feel like a fool sending these. Like I'm pouring my heart into some silly diary. Maybe I'll go visit with Isaac. Haven't seen him in a few days.\n"
