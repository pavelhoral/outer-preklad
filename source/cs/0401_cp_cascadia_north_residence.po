"- Sumner: called the meeting to discuss preparations for our imminent departure\n"
"- Pauline: platitudes, assurance that nobody is being fired\n"
"- Pauline: explains that jobs await us all on terra 2\n"
"- Pauline: more platitudes, top management is very pleased with project ptero and wants to ensure its assets are preserved\n"
"- C. McClure: so the project isn't being scuttled?\n"
"- Sumner: no, just moved off terra 1\n"
"- Violette: but how will we transport the pteros\n"
"- Ted: hunters will assist us in safely moving them onto the shuttle\n"
"- Violette: it was hard enough getting them into the cages in the first place\n"
"- Me: what about the raptidons? we've seen more and more around town\n"
"- Sumner: assurances that the raptidons are not interested in the pteros\n"
"- Me: but the hunters are saying-\n"
"- Sumner: no more about the pteros, floor is now open to general questions\n"
"- M. Cicero: how many shuttles are incoming?\n"
"- Pauline: we don't know. at least one\n"
"- Me: one isn't enough for all of us plus the damn pteros\n"
"- Sumner: let's worry about that when the evac arrives\n"
"- Sumner: looks like we're out of time. thanks for coming, everyone, and keep up the great work"
