msgid "Though all the pages are written by the same hand, they come in two distinct styles.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Most are in compact print, crammed to the edges of the page, with words frequently scribbled out. These are free-associational rambles on topics such as \"The Glorious Merits of the Potato, Most Noble of the Sundry Tubers That Grow in the Cupboard, Behind the Canned Peas.\"\r\n"
"\r\n"
"A few entries are in fluid longhand, tall letters with wide spacing. These often include uncorrected spelling or grammar errors. Most take the form of travelogues, explaining common points of knowledge about the Halcyon colony to some imagined future reader.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"The final entry is in the latter style of writing.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"----------\r\n"
"\r\n"
"The possibility of seeing kin has been no distraction at all.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"I reread old entries and wonder. Who was I writing for? What's the audience for this performance? Pages about beets, or the logistical complications of using cystpigs as improvised munitions.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"It amused me to go on like this, once. It entertained the crew. I'd jump up on the galley table and shout about something random, with conviction, in a voice like it was opera. Then I'd throw handfuls of fried potato sticks around and walk off feeling like I'd accomplished something, lightened someone's day, added the required dose of Surreal.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"The act can't be funny anymore, can it? I hear myself repeating words I've used before, with what feels like less enthusiasm. I hear a script that used to be improvisation.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"The longer we're stuck, the more I think like this. There's nothing to distract. I can't pick a direction and go, chase down a random piece of astro-debris. Bring the Whimbrel alongside some tumbling space rock, suit up, touch down. Walk a step. Sit. If there's dust, trace a picture or message with one finger. Then leave it to its business, to be found or not.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"\"I was the first here. I'll probably be the last. This is my small piece of eternity.\"\r\n"
"\r\n"
"I woke in the middle of the night again, my brains spinning with all the things to worry about. Getting out of here. Recovering the ship. Food and the crew's pay. The O2 stocks. And always the medicine, beyond reach, on that morning-star space station.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"I laid for hours in the dark, heart punching my ribcage, trying to breathe slow, holding still so the others wouldn't wake. I worried about things that never happened, phantasms invented by a drowsing brain. \"So important, must answer this in the morning, lives depend on it.\" Something about the navigation system? I don't remember.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"When my heart finally quieted, the others were stirring, so I got up. Must keep up appearances. Act normal. Stims all day to keep alert, in control, positive. Drinks in the evening, but not too many. Keep a careful balance, so my thoughts remain feathers, don't crash down. So the music and talk is a background wash, not an intruding cacophony.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"When you feel the undertow rising, put on the charm, smile, back out with a bow. Lock yourself in the washroom while your brain hisses, \"You should go, your time is past.\" Just a bit of indigestion, First Officer. Too much rotgut whiskey, no doubt.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"It's always been so easy to lie. Second nature. Simpler to grab a sword and drown out the thoughts that wait in quiet moments. Am I sure where the act ends and I begin? Which is real? The Morgan on telewaves? Laughing, gallant, charming? The Morgan in the dark, sleepless and afraid, wishing there was someone he didn't have to act for?\r\n"
"\r\n"
"It was a lark when we started. The thrill never got old. With the medicine, we could go on forever. It seemed important then, to stick a thumb in the eye of Board. To live as an example and help little folks, randomly, in odd places. Be the touch of Fortuna's grace that everyone hopes to see in their lives.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"We flew to the arctic after Hephaestus. I watched the edge of the ice crack and drift away. How thick was that when it began, I wonder? How many years did it carry on, unperturbed, seemingly immortal, before it became so thin and strained it fell to pieces?\r\n"
"\r\n"
"I hope Imogen is all right.\r\n"

"Talked with the Dissident Hunter crew again. They listened to my concerns. Offered a few counter-proposals that seemed reasonable. Big one was time on camera. They only wanted to pay for footage showing \"clear likenesses,\" but most of us wear helmets for protection. Compromise is that anyone wearing a \"visually distinctive\" helmet gets paid as if they were showing their face.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"So Ruby's got that damn pastel unicorn painted on the side of her helmet again.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Big problem continues to be how slow they are. They got their way of doing things, and it ain't how we work. I told Rachel-the-Producer, we get hard word of a Whimbrel's location, my crew assembles and lifts in twenty minutes, tops. She drew back like a marauder from a bath, said it was impossible to get her crew and \"talent\" moving that fast. I told her plain, if her people can't keep up with the pace of business, that ain't my problem. Went so far as to offer one of my own to run one of their cambot. She said no, something about liability.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Best we could figure between us was that we should try for ambushes. Set up situations that'll lure Morgan in. That way her mob of slow-asses can set up and do \"light checks\" and whatall before things happen.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Other allowance is that we'll be \"on mic\" at all times. They rigged up some audio gear in our outfits. We can turn them off, and review/erase bits, but they generally they want it rolling constantly.\r\n"

"\r\n"
"Curiously, you find two copies of each document. You compare two, side-by-side:\r\n"
"\r\n"
"One, in a barely legible scrawl, says, \"Two cargo seized on entry, known gunrunners, big spenders at Lost Hope and Stacks. Ship logs said sex toys from Groundbreaker. Seen that before (dodge, not toys), had Heryford pry the crates. Actually three gross frag grenades, prolly for Monarch. Confiscated and sent for demo. Captains given first and second strikes.\"\r\n"
"\r\n"
"The second, in cramped print, reads, \"Regular inspections completed to specification. No issues requiring report encountered. Midway continues to operate to expected levels of efficiency and security.\"\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Mixed among the paperwork is one page of a handwritten letter, with a coffee ring on one corner:\r\n"
"\r\n"
"---------------------------\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Gave Heryford the riot act for screwing up the Whimbrel inspection. Name's right on the damn ship! Said he was sorry, but I trust him about as far as I can spit into freighter backwash. Always looking for an angle, that one.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Eh, that's unkind. Not really looking. More like, if an angle shows up, he's going to grab it. Sort of half-assing where you don't never ask for a bribe, but don't feel no shame about ever taking one.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"I got folk on all the exits now. We're pulling long shifts. Too many holes, not enough us to plug them. I feel like an asshole sitting in a chair and keeping an ear to the radios. Feel like I should be out there DOING. But I can only be one place, and the best place is at the center.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Which is fucking boring.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Dozen times an hour I start up and start to head for the door. Stop before I get there and start pacing instead. Can't concentrate on the damn paperwork. I sit and stare at it, start thinking about what's going on at the wall, or shifting the schedules about so somebody can get more sleep, and then a fifteen minutes have passed and everybody's calling in their clear checks.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Topside, anyway. Still can't get a clean wireless signal Down Below. Something in the rocks. Only had this port running sixty years, think somebody'd come up with a solution. The cable I had run down the elevator shaft at least connects to the barracks. Call down on the cable, they wireless to the patrols. Hope somewhere along the way my \"hold as long as you think\" don't get changed into \"take off and get a drink.\"\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Ain't had a single night a home since this bullshit started. Only want three damn things after work. Microwave dinner, can of beer, tossball on the wireless. Nope. Cold cans of boarst and beans at the office and too damn many caffeine pills. Been riling my gut something fierce. Had to requisition more air freshener for the latrine.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Damnable thing is, it'll get worse if we actually nab the bastards. Whole damn port'll be swamped. Internal investigators from every damn company with a stake in the place, each one asking for incident reports in triplicate. Reporters who want \"just a quick quote, Chief\" all hours of the day. Then the managers coming down from Byzantium \"just to see where it happened.\"\r\n"
"\r\n"
"And you just know half those assholes gonna try lifting something from the scene. \"Just a memento, nothing anyone will notice.\" Then six months down the line a cargo gantry collapses because some random dumbshit thought no one could possibly miss a single bolt. Like I ain't never seen that happen before.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"I woke up tomorrow and somebody said Whimbrel got loose and slipped away in the night, gosh that'd be such a damn shame. I don't got enough problems without celebrity pirates squatting in my district."

"First thing I did was pay out for everybody who got killed. After that I started going through the injuries, worst first. Since we're all independent contractors, the sawbones would only take pay in bits up front. Had to barter away a few things on the sly. And I sold Kitchener's fucking poems to a collector from Byzantium.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"After squaring everybody else, there's just me. Right now I got a blanket between my eyeballs and the pulp that used to be my leg. Aside from paying for a nerve block, I still need to decide what to do. Cutting it off and getting a mechanical replacement is cheap but not practical. I'd lose too much mobility, never work again. Alternate's reconstruction and therapy. Relearn how to walk, pretty much. I got the will for it. Got the stamina. Just don't got the money.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"That's long-term shit. A sawbones working with me for months, getting new meat working proper with the old. Millions of bits. Even if I sold the ship, no guarantee that would cover it. And then I'd be fucked anyway, because I couldn't go where work is. I got no mind to die breaking rocks on Hephaestus.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"I got too used to it. That's the long and short. Following Kitchener, planning these ambushes, talking into cameras. The Dissident Hunter money is the best we ever made. Not the most -- the payout on Priya is still our biggest positive number ever. But the film money was reliable. Steady. I was paying down debts. Fixing things on the ship that had been broke for years. Even hired a few fresh gunhands.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"The film crew, they just went to their company for the hospital bill. One of them went in for a damn scratch. Flying shrapnel, stopped bleeding before they even got anybody to look at it. The sawbones clucked over him, dabbed on some fancy blue shit from the fridge, and said there wouldn't be a scar. I almost laughed.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"The worst was having to sit there and listen quiet while their money-man brayed about sunk costs and contract rights and how long I got to get back on my feet and hunting again. Too long and the contract's void.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Never figured on this. The folk we hunt don't leave foes breathing. Always thought that if I got the worst of a fight, that'd be the end of it right there. Bang. Shot through and gone. Not clean, probably, but quick. Just a flash, just heat. Or cold. Maybe I'd be dead before I even marked getting hit.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Now here I sit, one leg flattened by a piece of ceiling rubble. I'm fucking collateral damage from Whimbrel blowing out of Phil's two-bit, shithole dock.\r\n"

When he got distracted, he'd hum jingles from twenty years ago until somebody told him to quit it. When he heard a song he liked on the wireless, he'd freeze up like he touched a live wire, and if you bothered him before it was done he'd blink and stagger like he just woke up.\n"

"He listened better than anybody I've ever known. He knew when you needed a hug and when you needed to be left alone, and you never needed to tell him. He always gave the best birthday presents. Ones you carry with you forever, because they speak to something you probably never knew about yourself before.\n"

"I have taken refuge on an orbital relay station. It is smaller than a worker's hovel - barely a few thousand square meters! - but sufficient for my needs. I was able to flee Byzantium with enough bits to purchase supplies to last for decades. It was strange being among common people on the Groundbreaker. The whispers barely stirred at the sight of their ill-fed, scarred, and unwashed bodies. If only there were fewer freighters docking there, bringing real people from Byzantium, I could almost have made a home free of temptation. Free. Free.\n"
"\n"
"As I made this place livable - or as much as it can be - I started hearing the whispers from the relay terminal. They told me to listen to the voices traveling through the aether to reach me. Calling out to me to help them, alone, lonely, NEEDING my help. I found a way to power down the transmitter. No more voices in the aether, and NO MORE WHISPERS! They fell silent, silent, silent!\n"
"\n"
"This was not me! It's not! Not! I am not this foul thing that I have feared for so long. It was the voices in the aether trying to make me hurt others. But I was stronger than they, and I have defeated them. Them. Them!\n"
"\n"
"I have already begun making plans to return to my home. Now that the whispers are defeated, I can resume my life again. I can't wait to return. I miss my family and co-workers so much. Especially Delilah..."

The waves of sickness and population decline affecting the townships? They're all symptoms of this one problem: we're starving.\n"
