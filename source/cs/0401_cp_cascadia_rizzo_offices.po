"PUBLIC NOTICE #117: ON THE ISSUING OF A HAZARD CLAUSE FOR TERRA ONE\n"
"\n"
"This notice, issued on January 12th, 2343, serves as the public denouncement of Terra 1 as a feasible workplace environment.\n"
"\n"
"Due to the hostile and aggressive nature of the wildlife, as well as the unsustainability of its natural flora for use in human consumption, the Halcyon Holdings Corporate Board has officially enacted a Hazard Clause covering the entirety of Terra 1.\n"
"\n"
"After an evacuation period of no more than six (6) months, Terra 1 will be officially considered illegal territory. As this is a unanimous decision, any corporation caught operating on Terra 1 after the evacuation period will face fines and possible disbarment, as defined in Halcyon Code 22.1."

"Mr. Ziegler,\n"
"\n"
"We regret to inform you that the shuttles en route to the bottling facility at Cascadia have been re-routed. The evacuation effort is prioritized in order of profitability (measured chiefly by export volume), and as of this time, other facilities have proven themselves either more profitable or more efficient.\n"
"\n"
"The distribution system will send the minimum one (1) shuttle for evacuation purposes. If you have more personnel than can fit on a standard shuttle, Rizzo recommends establishing a priority system so that the loading and preparation of that shuttle can proceed smoothly. Please be advised that any attempt to load more than the maximum amount of human resources onto the shuttle will be met with forceful intervention.\n"

Project Ptero's importance may place it higher on your priority list, but we are still unable to send more than one (1) shuttle for evacuation. We suggest you balance your resources accordingly.\n"
