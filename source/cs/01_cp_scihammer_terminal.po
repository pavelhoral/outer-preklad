"While rummaging through the back bays, I discovered a very old Hammersmith crate that seemed to have been sealed for a very long time. A bit of elbow grease and determination pried it open, but I couldn't make heads or tails of my discovery - a prototype hammer. \r\n"
"\r\n"
"I didn't know Hammersmith actually made hammers, but I've brought it to my lab for a closer look.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"How strangely it glows. The trail of its wake lingers even when my eyes are closed. "

"I've spent more time on the hammer. Its internal workings are state of the art - thermal, electrical, and chemical systems all working in harmony. How is this even possible? The weapon is a breakthrough in circuitry and engineering, and many of its systems appear rigged against tampering. \r\n"
"\r\n"
"There's a curious energy signature swirling about the weapon, though I have yet to identify the source. The air tastes of copper. And I have lost several teeth. "

"I have had the most sublime, prismatic dreams since I invited the hammer into my bedchamber. \r\n"

"Never mind that for now. Good news first. The energy signature matches Blondiot's elusive N-rays, raising the hammer's elemental properties to four: shock, plasma, corrosion, and radiation.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Now for the bad. In my attempts to neuter the self-destruct functionality, I inadvertently caused a small fire. The hammer's manual controls may never function again. Swinging it seems to be the only way of cycling through its elemental modes.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"I must take greater care with future experiments."

"I've taken the liberty of locking myself in the workshop. My tinkerings were all for naught. This is no prototype - I am simply too flawed to recognize its perfections. \r\n"
"\r\n"
"The hammer is a lesson. A symbol. It whispers to me that disorder rules all things, but with a little ambition we can harness that power. Only by inflicting chaos upon others can we transmute disorder into harmony. \r\n"
"\r\n"
"And that is a lesson Halcyon is not ready to hear. "
