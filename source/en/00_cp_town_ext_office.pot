"Dear Lawrence,\r\n"
"\r\n"
"I appreciate your hard work on behalf of our beloved brand of saltuna. I've just received a response from corporate. They're not interested in your idea of a \"light\" version of the Saltuna brand, because we'd rather not compete with ourselves.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"But they ARE interested in the idea of lighter saltuna! Effective immediately, we have been instructed to use heavier weighted cans, so we can pack them with less saltuna, thereby saving bits to every can.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"This is exactly the kind of breakthrough our cannery needs. In fact, our logistics department has just confirmed my request to have you transferred from the marketing division to the cannery. Can you imagine, Lawrence? You'll be rubbing elbows with your fellow workers on the canning line, filling each slightly-heavier can with slightly-less saltuna, hour after hour, day after day. This is a great and tremendous honor, for you and for me.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Effective immediately, your position in our marketing division has been terminated. I expect you to report to our foreman tomorrow morning. Your uniform will be deducted from your pay.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Welcome!"
