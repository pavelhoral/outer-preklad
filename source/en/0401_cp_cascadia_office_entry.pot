"I contest these violations on the following grounds:\r\n"
"\r\n"
"- I'm allergic to Purpleberry. Making one of our pre-approved Purpleberry Lunch meals will literally kill me. To be candid, it is a miracle I have lived here this long without incident.\r\n"
"- I can't volunteer for overtime because I've already been assigned overtime shifts!\r\n"
"- OK, I'll fess up to selling restricted goods. You got me there. Selling soap to a man who stinks so bad I can't smell the sulfur around him is against the rules. Fine. I won't do it anymore.\r\n"
