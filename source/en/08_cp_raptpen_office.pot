"SUBJECT: The Mating Habits of the Common Raptidon\n"
"\n"
"Chief Porter,\n"
"\n"
"Our raptidons seem to be experiencing a problem of the intimate variety. If the Law has instilled in these bloodthirsty beasts the instinct toward self-preservation, then that instinct does not seem to manifest in procreation. If anything, the internal logic of the common raptidon is to ensure the survival of its species by butchering every other living creature within sight.\n"
"\n"
"My other working theory is that these raptidons refuse to breed, and I do not know why.\n"
"\n"
"I have attempted to play music for them. No luck.\n"
"\n"
"Please tell Mr. Crane I'm working as hard as I can to resolve this issue. I understand he's eager to test the genetic makeup of the Raptidon Alpha for its possible applications in improving our dental hygiene. \n"

"Given the secrecy of our operation, I hardly think we're in any danger of falling prey to roving outlaws. For goodness sake, Anton. We're on the ass-end of Terra 2 here.\n"
