"\r\n"
"At any rate, the worker was in a sorry state. Fever. Shallow breathing. Delirious. Must have been plagued. I set him right with a diet of greens. He was all better in a couple weeks. Physically. Spiritually. He's one of our flock now."

"May the Eternal bless my first endeavor. It's been two days since I walked away from life at the Edgewater cannery. Fortuitously, the old botanical labs are still operational. Mostly. The soil's sour. I'll do what I can, but I'm going to need some powerful fertilizer.\r\n"

"Flora are living things, as sensitive to their environment as any breathing, thinking body. I contend that the crops in this region failed because the corporate scientists tending to them are cold, heartless, inhumane people acting on behalf of a sterile and inhumane power. One cannot expect your crops to flush with green and reach for the sky under these conditions.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"The soil is sour, it's true. I don't know quite how to explain that. I am sure the Scienticians will say something about biology or the carbon cycle. \r\n"
"\r\n"
"But I can conclude, after months of my own experimentation, that the secret to a rich and wholesome garden is love, attention, compassion, and a natural fertilizer bursting with organic materials. Just as nature intended."

"I am hereby repurposing this botanical lab from its original conception as a gear in the soulless automaton of the corporate machine. This greenhouse may look impressive, but like all Spacer's Choice products, it is cheap and unreliable. I shall have to make some repairs with my own two hands.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"This place shall become a nursery. Before it was abandoned, I understand the horticulturalists failed to produce a single viable crop. Something about the soil being too poor. \r\n"
