"Just got back from Billingsly's. Had not one, not two, but three NearMaple liqueurs. Almost done with this project I've been working on for the past six months. Decided to celebrate. Hey, don't worry. I'll save some celebrating for the two of us. I'm thinking maybe Celeste's Haberdashery. Stop over at Lovegrove's. Couple hours at Chancery's. End the night with a bang at Bijou's. What do you think?"
