"Result #1 >>> from the Site Supervisor's Personal Logs: \n"
"\n"
"\"That captain sold Harris something called the 'Rearranger,' then left before we discovered the damn thing doesn't work. Only thing it rearranged is the number of bits on Harris's cart. Looks like some strange tech or a weapon. Maybe a scientist can make something of it?\"\n"

"Result #2  >>> from the Site Safety Officer's Incident Report: \n"
"\n"
"\"Doc Caulfield couldn't save Lem. Now I gotta arrest Harris for his murder. Confiscated that weapon he used and stored it in Bertie's office for now. Figure the least the Site Supervisor can do is fill out the forms for whatever that damn thing is. Don't know how I'm gonna detain Harris. Not like we got prison cells on this rock.\"\n"

"\"Given Name: Lemuel\n"
"Family Name: Heryford\n"
"Employment Status: Indenture\n"
"Contract Term: 35 years, 2 months, 16 days, 5 hours, 33 minutes (approx.) remaining\n"
"Time of Deceasement: 18:27 hours (approx.)\n"
"Cause of Deceasement: Blunt force trauma. Weapon unknown. Took a good whack to the noggin. The facial area, to be specifical about it. It's all twisted up, too. Nose is five times too big, jaw is shrunk to almost nothin'. Teeth are all out of kilter, though I suppose that was true pre-deceasement. If the blow itself didn't kill 'im, there's no way he could've breathed with all that damage.\""
