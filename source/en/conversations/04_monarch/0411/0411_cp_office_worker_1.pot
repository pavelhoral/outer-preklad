"TO: A. Rose\n"
"SUBJECT: The end is upon us.\n"
"\n"
"I don't want to say I told you so, but I did message you that the writing was on the wall back in April. Did I not? (Which, if you remember, is one of the reasons I begged you to please hurry in your decision making, which inadvertently and unfortunately stoked your ire at me for rushing you.)\n"
"\n"
"But now everything I feared is coming to pass - C&P's abandoned Monarch with the others. The factory's in working order, but less and less of us keep showing up for shifts. 'Cause what's the point, really? Never got my last two bit carts for wages owed which means I can't pay rent, Aggie, let alone sponsor your wastrel of a cousin's gambling habits. I know how you titter it away whenever I raise these sorts of concerns, but I'm not joking, Aggie. It's only a matter of time before I'm plumb out in the streets. \n"
"\n"
"What're you going to do then? Keep telling me to wait?\n"
"\n"
"I can't. \n"
"\n"
"The next ferry's scheduled for Thursday at 2 o'clock. I'll be on it, and I'd like you to join me. If you do, then I'll have your answer at last. If not... then I guess I'll have an answer the same. Either way, I won't be waiting for another month on end.\n"
"\n"
"See you at the ferry platform (I hope).\n"

"Yours in heart if not body,\n"

"What're your thoughts on that clog? Can't be a raptidon - weren't no scales. And there ain't enough cysts for it to have been a wayward pig. But I'll be damned if I ever seen vermin so large. \n"
"\n"
"I'll admit I was skeptical when you called me and the fellas back to the factory, like we were gonna run it rogue (well, I guess we did) - but you were right. There was money ripe for the picking, even without C&P's umbrella, and I just want you to know... I appreciate what you did. For each of us.\n"
"\n"
"P.S - Best have maintenance check the grating on the vents. That's the second clog this month.\n"
