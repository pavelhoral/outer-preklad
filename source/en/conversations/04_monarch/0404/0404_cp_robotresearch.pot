"Our quarters here may be tiny, but Herbert continues to investigate its every nook and cranny with utter delight. I am pleased to report that he shows no signs of distress following our sojourn into this humble new home.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"I have brought with me everything I can take from the surface. Our ex-colleagues continue to try and live above ground, though they have barred the north gate from the encroaching raptidons.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"They remain unaware as to the existence of this hideaway, and I aim to keep it so. If they found my store of food, they'd surely seek to divide it amongst themselves.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Recalling my emergency training, though it was years ago, I have managed to secure intubation to sustain you while you sleep so peacefully.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Properly rationed, our supplies here will last some years - surely enough that Rizzo will come to rescue us. At the very least, Herbert shall survive well through his adolescent years - with proper rationing, perhaps even into adulthood.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"As for myself, my wounds have begun to smell. Herbert pretends not to notice but the way his nose crinkles reminds me of how you used to laugh.\r\n"

"\r\n"
"With any luck, should the infection in my leg continue to grow, these machines will handily replace my fatherly duties and maintain the loving care required to raise Herbert and nurse you back to health. To my surprise, the cooking model is even capable of limited tutoring services.\r\n"
