"The bad news is that we've got a sprat problem. Thanks to the little monsters chewing on our wires, our ventilation system is temporarily offline. If your raptidons are cranky, you'll need to sedate them manually. Bring a few canisters of sedative and hook it up to the auxiliary terminal in the main research chamber.\n"
"\n"
"The good news is that my Hephaestos Hammers clobbered your precious Rizzo's Rangers. Would you care for some Auntie Cleo's Tripicale Pasta Sauce with your humble pie?\n"

"Please explain the unmitigated disaster I'm currently holding in my hand. I have here a form approving the relocation of our Raptidon mother to the main hall. A form signed by you.\n"

"First of all, the structural integrity of our raptidon tanks are not nearly sufficient to contain an enraged raptidon mother.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, raptidons are notoriously territorial and extremely protective of their young.\n"
"\n"
"Please stop me if I'm using too many numbers for you. I know you have a problem with basic arithmetic, seeing how you don't seem to realize that Raptidon Mother + Raptidon Tank = Murder.\n"
