"\r\n"
"To whom it may concern,\r\n"
"\r\n"
"If you are reading this, then I am no longer the outpost administrator for Edgewater. Whether through the shedding of my mortal coil through natural causes, or through early retirement, the stewardship of Edgewater has passed on to someone else. You.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"But most importantly: it is imperative that you keep the Spacer's Choice family together. Adelaide McDevitt and her followers have taken camp in the old Botanical Lab. Their place is here, working with us. Adelaide is impervious to reason and refuses to entertain diplomatic overtures. The only way to induce her into coming back is by heading into the geothermal plant, cutting off her power, and leading her people back to Edgewater. \r\n"
"\r\n"
"With the power shut off at the Botanical Labs, feel free to repossess any useful equipment contained therein. Especially power regulators.\r\n"
"\r\n"
"Postscript: If you do restore the power to Edgewater, would you consider mentioning my name in the profits report? A little posthumous credit couldn't hurt.\r\n"
