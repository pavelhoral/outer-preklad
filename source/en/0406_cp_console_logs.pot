"As I stated in my prior FOUR messages, there is simply no cause for alarm. I swear to you, Hiram, the situation is under control. \n"
"\n"
"What you call a \"near-emergency,\" I would consider a non-event. Yes, a high-energy transmission was used for too lengthy a period of time. And yes, the generators cannot safely support that activity. Yes and yes, they could have been damaged under load. But the point remains -- nothing happened.\n"
"\n"
"We caught the issue in time. The engineers involved were reprimanded.\n"
"\n"
"I swear on my mama's grave, it will not happen again.\n"
"\n"
"Now, please, cease contacting me for daily updates on the status of the generators.\n"

"What in the black hole were you thinking, Val? At some point, \"space efficiency\" becomes the inverse to \"time efficiency\" and one negates the other. What I mean is, how am I to do my morning business when the toilets are directly facing the open showers? You might like watching fellows scrub their jigglies while you take a steaming dump, but I don't.\r\n"
